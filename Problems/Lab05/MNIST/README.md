## MNIST

### Direction

You should first download dependencies first : numpy and torchvision.

Copy two files to local : grader.py and mnist.py.

You need to implement class Softmax, Sigmoid, and Affine and one function that returns Model that predicts MNIST.

Each class is implementation of Neuron that has forward and backward functions.

You can test your code by running ```grader.py```. Note that you need to run grader.py in the same directory as mnist.py.

You only need to submit mnist.py.

You may edit grader.py if you want to change the test cases, but it will not be affect to your submission.
