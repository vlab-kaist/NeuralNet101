# XOR

## Direction

### Download dependencies

You should first download dependencies first : numpy.

Copy two files to local : grader.py and xor.py.

### Implement

You need to implement two class implements NeuronAbstract : Sigmoid and Affine,
one class implements ModelAbstract : Model,
and one function that returns Model that predicts XOR operator correctly.

Sigmoid, Affine are implementation of Neuron that has forward and backward functions.
Model is implementation of ModelAbstract that has forward and backward functions.

You can test your code by running ```grader.py```. Note that you need to run grader.py in the same directory as xor.py.

### Submit

You only need to submit xor.py.

You may edit grader.py if you want to change the test cases, but it will not be affect to your submission.
